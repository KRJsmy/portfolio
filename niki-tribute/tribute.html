            <h2>Nicole Zefanya</h2>
            <h4>Indonesian Songwriter</h4>
            <p><b>Nicole Zefanya</b> (born 24 January 1999), known professionally as NIKI, (stylized in all uppercase), is an Indonesian songwriter and record producer. She is currently based in the United States and signed with the record label.
               <b>Zefanya</b> was born on 24 January 1999 and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia.

                At nine years old, Zefanya taught herself how to play the guitar. At 13, she began writing original music. Although her music is partially influenced by her mother, who exposed Zefanya to soul, gospel, and 1990s' R&B like Destiny's Child and Aaliyah when she was young, Zefanya's earliest original music skewed towards the folk and indie genres.
                
                She attended Pelita Harapan School and obtained a high school degree before pursuing an undergraduate degree in music at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee on a scholarship.</p>
