                            <p>19 years old. I live in Camolinas, Poblacion, Cordova, Cebu. As a student majoring in
                                Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, I received my diploma from Cordova Catholic Cooperative School. I'm

                            <p>You can call me "Dean", 23 years old. 
                                I lived in Babag II Lapu-lapu city and currently pursuing my studies in college at Cordova Public College taking up a 
                                Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. After I finished my studies in Senior High I wasn't able to proceed my 
                                college due to financial problem and that's why I worked at Timex Inc. for 6 months and after my contract ended I tried 
                                joining modeling agencies as well as pageantry and right now I am currently a candidate of Mister Filipinas Talisay. 
                                One of my hobby is working out, I workout hard not because I want to have a nice body but also I want to enhance my confidence and boost my self esteem.</p>

                            <p>19 years old. I was raised in Buagsong, Cordova, Cebu. I received an ABM diploma from Cordova National High School. 
                                And right now I'm studying at Cordova Public College to complete my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology. Even though I'm not particularly talented at drawing,
